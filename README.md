# Kaggle Submissions

This repository contains my submissions and solutions for various Kaggle competitions in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
Each competition has its own directory.

## Competitions

### Active Competitions
- **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**: The competition on Kaggle challenges participants to build a predictive model that determines which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using historical passenger data such as age, sex, class, and fare.


### Completed Competitions


## Tools and Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, pytorch, xgboost, lightgbm
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Environment**: Conda, Jupyter Notebooks

## Approach and Methodology

Each competition folder contains:
- **Data exploration and analysis** - Understanding the dataset and problem
- **Feature engineering** - Creating and selecting relevant features
- **Model development** - Experimenting with different algorithms
- **Model validation** - Cross-validation and performance evaluation
- **Final submission** - Best performing model and predictions

## Key Learnings

This section will be updated with insights and techniques learned from each competition:
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Feature engineering strategies
- Model selection and ensemble methods
- Cross-validation strategies
- Domain-specific approaches

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mal0101/Kaggle-Submissions.git
   cd Kaggle-Submissions
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific competition folder:
   ```bash
   cd competition-name/
   ```

3. Create and activate the competition-specific environment:

**NB**: I personally chose to seperate environments for each competition folder so that there are no dependency difficulties.


## Competition Guidelines

- Each competition has its own folder with a dedicated README
- Code is documented and reproducible
- Data files are gitignored but download scripts are provided where possible
- Model files are tracked using Git LFS for large files
- Each competition has its own conda environment for reproducibility
